   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

## 📋 Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. Place your Starship launch videos in the `flight_recordings` folder
2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the interactive menu to process videos and generate analyses

### Workflow

```text
Flight Recording → Frame Processing → Data Extraction → Analysis → Visualization
```

1. **Input**: Add SpaceX webcast recordings to the `flight_recordings` directory
2. **Processing**: Extract telemetry data through parallel frame processing
3. **Analysis**: Clean data, calculate derived metrics, and detect patterns
4. **Output**: Generate visualizations and comparison plots in the `results` directory

### Logging System

The application maintains detailed logs to help with troubleshooting:

- Each session creates a timestamped log file in the `logs` directory
- Log files follow the format `starship_analyzer_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Console output shows essential information while full details are saved to log files
- System hardware and software details are logged at startup for troubleshooting
- For debugging issues, check the latest log file in the `logs` directory

### Debug Mode

Debug mode provides enhanced logging and diagnostic information to help troubleshoot issues:

- Enable/disable debug mode directly from the main menu using the "Toggle Debug Mode" option
- When enabled, detailed diagnostic information is logged about:
  - OCR processing and text extraction
  - Engine detection with pixel values
  - Memory usage and CUDA device information
  - Detailed data processing steps and statistics
- Use debug mode when:
  - Troubleshooting extraction issues with specific frames
  - Diagnosing performance problems or accuracy issues
  - Developing new features or fixing bugs
  - Analyzing the internal behavior of the application

Debug mode logs are more verbose but provide valuable insights when resolving complex issues.

### Available Commands

The application's main menu provides several options:

| Menu Option | Submenu | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Video Processing** | | Options for extracting data from videos |
| | **Process random video frame** | Test extraction on a single frame to validate setup |
| | **Process complete video** | Extract data from all frames in a recording |
| **Data Visualization** | | Options for visualizing extracted data |
| | **Visualize flight data** | Generate plots from processed launch data |
| | **Visualize multiple launches data** | Compare metrics across different flights |
| **Download Media** | | Options for downloading Starship launch videos |
| | **Download from launch list** | Download videos from curated list of Starship launches |
| | **Download from custom URL** | Download videos from custom YouTube or Twitter/X URLs |
| **Toggle Debug Mode** | | Enable/disable detailed diagnostic information |
| **Exit** | | Exit the application |

## 🔍 How It Works

Starship Analyzer uses a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Frame Extraction**: Video frames are extracted and queued for processing
2. **OCR Processing**: Specialized regions of interest (ROIs) are analyzed to extract telemetry
3. **Engine Detection**: Computer vision techniques identify active engines
4. **Fuel Level Detection**: Analysis of propellant gauge indicators for LOX and CH4 tank levels
5. **Data Cleaning**: Statistical methods remove outliers and noise
6. **Analysis**: Calculates acceleration, G-forces, and performance metrics
7. **Visualization**: Generates plots showing vehicle performance, engine status, and fuel consumption

The processed data is available through an interactive visualization interface that lets you explore:

- Time-synchronized telemetry readings
- Engine activation patterns
- Fuel consumption rates
- Performance metrics across different flight phases
- Comparative analysis between multiple launches

## 🚀 Performance Tips

- Processing high-resolution videos requires significant computing resources
- GPU acceleration dramatically improves OCR processing speed (5-10x faster)
- Adjust batch sizes in the menu for optimal performance on your system:
  - For systems with <16GB RAM: Use batch sizes of 5-10
  - For systems with >16GB RAM: Batch sizes up to 20-30 are effective
- Consider pre-processing large videos to trim them to relevant segments
- The application automatically detects and uses CUDA if available
- For large videos, increase sample rate (e.g., process every 5th frame) to speed up processing
