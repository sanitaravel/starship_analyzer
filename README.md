## üìä What is Starship Analyzer?

Starship Analyzer automatically extracts critical flight data from SpaceX's Starship launch webcasts, including:

- **Speed and altitude measurements** extracted from video telemetry overlay
- **Engine ignition status and patterns** across all Raptor engines
- **Fuel level monitoring** for LOX (liquid oxygen) and CH4 (methane) in both stages
- **Timestamps and synchronization** to T-0 events
- **Acceleration and G-force calculations** for engineering analysis

The tool processes video frames in parallel, cleans the extracted data, and generates comprehensive visualizations to help you understand the performance characteristics of each launch.

## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature | Description |

| **Telemetry Extraction** | OCR system optimized for SpaceX's Starship telemetry overlay |
| **Engine Status Detection** | Real-time tracking of individual engine ignition states |
| **Fuel Level Analysis** | Monitoring of LOX and CH4 tank levels in Superheavy booster and Starship |
| **Performance Analysis** | Calculates derived metrics like acceleration and G-forces |
| **Multi-launch Comparison** | Compare performance metrics across different Starship test flights |
| **Interactive Visualizations** | Generate detailed graphs and plots with zoom capabilities, tooltips, and exportable formats |
| **Parallel Processing** | Efficiently processes video frames using multi-core architecture |
| **User-friendly CLI** | Simple menu-driven interface with no programming knowledge required |

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended but optional)
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for processing high-resolution videos

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sanitaravel/starship_analyzer.git
cd starship_analyzer

# Run the setup script
python setup.py

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

For detailed installation instructions, including manual setup and troubleshooting, see the [Installation Wiki](https://github.com/sanitaravel/starship_analyzer/wiki/Installation).

## üìã Basic Usage

1. Place your Starship launch videos in the `flight_recordings` folder
2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the interactive menu to process videos and generate analyses

The workflow follows this pattern:
```text
Flight Recording ‚Üí Frame Processing ‚Üí Data Extraction ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Visualization
```

1. **Input**: Add SpaceX webcast recordings to the `flight_recordings` directory
2. **Processing**: Extract telemetry data through parallel frame processing
3. **Analysis**: Clean data, calculate derived metrics, and detect patterns
4. **Output**: Generate visualizations and comparison plots in the `results` directory

## üîç How It Works

Starship Analyzer uses a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Frame Extraction**: Video frames are extracted and queued for processing
2. **OCR Processing**: Specialized regions of interest (ROIs) are analyzed to extract telemetry
3. **Engine Detection**: Computer vision techniques identify active engines
4. **Fuel Level Detection**: Analysis of propellant gauge indicators for LOX and CH4 tank levels
5. **Data Cleaning**: Statistical methods remove outliers and noise
6. **Analysis**: Calculates acceleration, G-forces, and performance metrics
7. **Visualization**: Generates plots showing vehicle performance, engine status, and fuel consumption

The processed data is available through an interactive visualization interface that lets you explore:

- Time-synchronized telemetry readings
- Engine activation patterns
- Fuel consumption rates
- Performance metrics across different flight phases
- Comparative analysis between multiple launches
